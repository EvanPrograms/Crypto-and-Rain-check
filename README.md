# Crypto-and-Rain-check
Sends an automated text if it will rain in the next 12 hours, and for a crypto price (and percent change), using set environmental variables set in another file.


Use pythonanywhere to automate the task.

You can change the choice of coin pulled from coinmarketcap. 

Create a file called '.env' and set your environmental variables in a folder as so:

export HER_PHONE=X
export AUTH_TOKEN=X
export OWM_PHONE=X
export COINMARKETKEY=X
export MY_PHONE=X
export ACCOUNT_SID=X
export HIS_PHONE=X
export OWM_API_KEY=X
